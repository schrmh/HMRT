Home Menu Rebuilding Tool (HMRT) v0.8  
=====================================  
### NOW FOR GNU/LINUX!  

----
  
This is WIP!  
Feel free to contribute (e.g. code or tutorials)  

A full rebuild doesn't work yet and will lead to a softbrick.
I will investigate which part is wrong by testing each step individually (and doing all other steps in a Windows VM) when I have time.
I don't plan to test the xorpad parts soon and I would be glad if you could test them for me.
